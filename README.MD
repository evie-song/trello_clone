# Trello Clone

this repo is a clone of trello I made to learn and practice python/django

this app is hosted on render.com at following url `https://trello-clone-c2mj.onrender.com/`, feel free to give it a try. Note this app uses a sqlite DB and your data may be lost if I re-deploy. 

to run the app locally, follow below steps:

1. clone the repo
2. install the dependencies: run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. start local server: run `python3 manage.py runserver`
4. navigate to `localhost:8000` 
5. create your account or use username `testuser1` and password `Test@ccount` to give it a try


this clone app resembles the ui design of the workflow app `trello.com` and incudes below features:
1. basic user authentication 
2. create, edit and delete boards, lists and cards
3. drag and drop lists and cards
4. on cards, add descriptions, assign members, attach labels, create checklist and assign due dates

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions at evie.shuangsong@gmail.com

Below are a few screenshots.

This app is still a work in progress, but thanks for taking a look!
