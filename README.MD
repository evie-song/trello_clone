# Trello Clone

This repo is a clone of trello I made to learn and practice python/django

to give it a try, clone the repo and then run `python manage.py runserver` and navigate to `localhost:8000`

you can create an account on the sqlite DB by navigating to `localhost:8000/users/register` 

#### NOTE - registering doesn't currently log you in, after registering a new user, click the link to go to the login page XD

This app is still a work in progress, but thanks for taking a look!
