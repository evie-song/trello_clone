# Trello Clone

This repo is a clone of trello I made to learn and practice python/django

to give it a try, follow below steps:

1. clone the repo
2. install python and django: run `brew install python` and then `pip3 install django`
3. activate virtual environmenet: naviagte to project folder and run `source trello_clone_env/bin/activate`
4. start local server: run `python manage.py runserver` or `python3 manage.py runserver`
5. navigate to `localhost:8000` 
6. create your account or use username `XXXX` and password `XXXX` to give it a try


this clone app resembles the ui design of the workflow app `trello.com` and incudes below features:
1. basic user authentication 
2. create, edit and delete boards, lists and cards
3. shuffle lists and cards
4. on cards, add descriptions, assign members, attach labels, create checklist and assign due dates

This app is still a work in progress, but thanks for taking a look!
